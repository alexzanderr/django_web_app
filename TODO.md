# TODOS

- [x] add base index html
- [x] add static folder for every app and tell django where its located
- [x] extend a template that is not in the current app, but it is in root/templates
- [x] extend a template that is in the same dir as current template
- [x] what if the templates do have the same name in different templates folder, what do you do?; you create `app/templates/app/index.html`; with this you can tell django to load `app/index.html` and you can keep the index without naming like `app_index.html`
- [x] pytest https://djangostars.com/blog/django-pytest-testing/
- [x] add Jquery as local module, not from CDN, and also for socket io
- [x] add classes as views
- [x] run server with interactive mode (you cant because python REPL is not multi-threaded; instead you can run `python manage.py shell` and this will open a shell with REPL with django settings)
- [x] add rich traceback to django runserver
- [x] try djongo, just like mongo alchemy - https://www.djongomapper.com/get-started/
- [x] create tmux session for this project
- [ ] add generate random password button in JS for register UI
- [ ] add view password checkbox for register
- [x] how to test django mini apps individually? because there is a tests file or folder inside every app; with pytest you create a tests folder and pytest will take care of the rest
- [ ] add pytest-factoryboy and faker for databases
- [ ] test frontend with selenium (here we need a person to watch the page changes)
- [x] django how to list all routes automatically on a page (python manage.py shell -c 'from django.core.management import call_command; from django_extensions.management.commands.show_urls import Command; call_command(Command())')
- [ ] consider putting all django apps in the main app under a folder called "apps"
- [ ] add table of contents to your site, just like real python
- [ ] add view count to a page "this page has been viewed fot 15 times"
- [ ] add stripe to django, at least for testing
- [ ] add celery to django
- [x] add custom 404 beautiful page
- [ ] change text selection on frontend
- [ ] add livereload to tmux session
- [ ] try Sass css framework
- [ ] add check availability after typing a username in real time with async
- [ ] add progress bar when making a reqest in the UI
- [ ] migrate from mongo client to djongo models

This usually indicates a bug in the application where a module was not imported and decorators or other functionality was called too late.
To fix this make sure to import all your view modules, database models, and everything related at a central place before the application starts serving requests.
